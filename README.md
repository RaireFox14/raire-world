# raire-world

Hello, peoples.
My name is Raire and I'm a neko.
Half human and half fox.
It's pretty cool except for the fact that I must deal with continuously turning into a fox when I get too excited.
This is obviously fake but I like to believe that I could actually be inhuman.
Anyway, my name is Raire, nice to meet you.
